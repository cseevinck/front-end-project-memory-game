## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

## Play instructions
+ click on two tiles to see if they match. If they do they will remain face-up. If they 
  not match they will be hidden again after 1 second. Try to remember where which cards are.
+ Click on a different pair. If you see one you have seen before, you have another pair      you can expose.
+ When you have exposed all the tiles you will be declared the winner.

## Dependancies 
+ Icons - Font Awesome
+ Google fonts
